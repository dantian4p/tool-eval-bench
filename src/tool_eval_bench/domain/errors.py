"""Headless error codes for machine-readable JSONL error events.

These constants are the canonical error codes emitted in ``--json`` mode
when the benchmark fails before scenario execution begins.  External
integrators (e.g. sparkrun) can exhaustively match on these values.

Each constant maps to a specific exit code:
    - Exit 1: runtime error, generic failure
    - Exit 2: connection/HTTP error (server unreachable or bad response)
    - Exit 3: server responded but has no models loaded

Usage in CLI:
    ``_headless_error(NO_SERVER, "...", exit_code=2)``
